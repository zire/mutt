# Set Up Mutt and Offlineimap to Read Gmail

My configuration of [Mutt](http://www.mutt.org/#doc) and [Offlineimap](http://www.offlineimap.org/documentation.html) borrowed heavily from the below guides/references:

- Archlinux.org's guide on [Mutt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mutt) and [Offlineimap](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/OfflineIMAP) are extremely comprehensive and helpful.
- [How I Use Offlineimap](http://bkanuka.com/articles/offlineimap-mutt/), useful scripts of using Offlineimap effectively to mitigate some of its known issues.
- [Use Mac OS X's Keychain for Password Retrieval in OfflineIMAP](https://blog.aedifice.org/2010/02/01/use-mac-os-xs-keychain-for-password-retrieval-in-offlineimap/), important scripts that use `security` command line tool and `Keychain` app on OSX to retrieve password directly from Keychain, to avoid displaying Gmail password in plain-text in `.offlineimaprc` file.
